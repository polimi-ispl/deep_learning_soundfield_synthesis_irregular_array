[Home](/deep_learning_soundfield_synthesis_irregular_array/index.html) 

In this page we show results corresponding to reproduction of a single source when using the deep learning-based model presented in  [[1]](#references), denoted as CNN, the Model-based rendering technique presented in [[2]](#references) denoted as MR and the pressure-matching approach [[3]](#references) denoted as PM. We consider a regular loudspeaker array of 64 elements and randomly remove 16,32, and 48 loudspeakers, ending with a 48,32,16 element array, respectively


# Training/test setup
In the image we show the setup used to generate the training and test data.
